### Basic Rules

- 2 players take turns placing either an X or an O in one of the squares on the grid. You can assume that the players swap who has control of the mouse on their turn.
- If either player gets 3 of their symbol in a row, they win the game.
- You should have logic for validating a users move to ensure it's legal (can't place a symbol over another symbol).
- Have some minimal CSS styling for the game. I don’t expect for you to spend too much time on it.
- Doesn’t need to be executable (e.g. if you’re using React, then just focus on the components needed).

### Notes

- Unit test can be added.
- CSS can be impoved.
- 9 Cell components can be manipulated with using nested for loops.
